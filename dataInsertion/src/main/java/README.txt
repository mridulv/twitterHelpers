In this project we are doing various things:

1) analysis.java -> It goes through the current database and finds the tweets for the corresponding entity
2) newMYSQLconnection.java -> In this file we are actually dumping the flume data one by one into the MYSQL database
3) timeStamp.java -> This file is used for reading the timestamp and converting the time into seconds and updating the same.
